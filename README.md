# ESPN Fantasy Automation Bot

Bot built using python and selenium to automate setting an ESPN Fantasy basketball lineup. When making the decision between 2 players, the bot uses the higher roster percentage to decide who should be played. 

Bot can also be automated to run every morning. 
In my case I used Google Cloud Platform and Kron to automate the bot every morning
